# Random Art

 A RandomArtPanel draws random pictures which might be taken to have some vague resemblance to abstract art.  A new picture is produced every four seconds. There are three types of pictures:  random lines, random circles, and random 3D rectangles.  The figures are drawn in random colors on a background that is a random shade of gray.
 
 A `main()` routine allows this class to be run as a program

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
