 * A RandomArtPanel draws random pictures which might be taken to have

 * four seconds.  There are three types of pictures:  random lines,
 * random circles, and random 3D rects.  The figures are drawn in
 * random colors on a background that is a random shade of gray.
 * A main() routine allows this class to be run as a program
